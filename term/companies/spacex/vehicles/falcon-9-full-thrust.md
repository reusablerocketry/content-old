The Falcon 9 Full Thrust (also called "F9FT", the "Falcon 9 v1.2", the
"upgraded Falcon 9", and sometimes the "Falcon 9.2") is an upgraded
[Falcon 9 v1.1](term) with about 30% more performance to enable
recovery attempts for each launch. To increase the energy stored in
the limited size of the vehicle's tanks, the Falcon 9 Full Thrust
vehicle features densified [LOx](term) (cooled to -206 degrees
centigrade) and, to a lesser extent, [RP-1](term). This results in
more fuel being stored in the same vehicle, which keeps the size down
and increases the stored energy.

The Falcon 9 Full Thrust also features an upgraded [Merlin 1D](term),
which is slightly more powerful than before. The
[Merlin 1D vacuum engine](term) has been improved as well, providing
slightly more efficiency with a larger [engine bell](term).
