The Falcon 9 v1.1 is the second member of the [SpaceX](term)
[Falcon 9 launch vehicle family](term:falcon9). Despite being heavily
modified, it is derived from the [Falcon 9 v1.0](term) vehicle. It is a
[two stage to orbit](term) vehicle, with nine [Merlin 1D](term)
engines on the first stage and one [Merlin 1D vacuum](term) engine on
the second stage. The Falcon 9 v1.1 is about 40% taller than the
Falcon 9 v1.0 and has about 60% more thrust as well.

The Falcon 9 v1.1 is no longer in production, having been superseded
by the [Falcon 9 Full Thrust](term).
